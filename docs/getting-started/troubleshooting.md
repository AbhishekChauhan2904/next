## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does Directus handle deploying or migrating projects?

Directus includes [export](#) and [backup](#) tools to assist in deploying data changes between environments (eg: from _development_ to _production_), however there is no formal migration workflow.

Additionally, since Directus stores all of your data in pure SQL, you can use almost any preexisting workflow or toolkit for this process.

### Does Directus support Mongo/NoSQL?

Not currently. Directus has been built specifically for wrapping _relational_ databases. While we could force Mongo to use tables, columns, and rows via Mongoose object modeling, that approach to non-structured doesn't make a lot of sense. We realize many users are interested in this feature, and will continue to explore its possibility.

### Why haven't you added X feature, or fixed Y issue yet?

Directus is primarily a free and open-source project, maintained by a small core team and community contributors who donate their time and resources.

Our platform is feature-rich, however we strictly adhere to our [80/20 Rule](#) to avoid a messy/bloated codebase. Directus is also quite stable, however new issues still arise, some of which may be triaged with a lower prioritization.

If you require more expeditious updates, you can contact us regarding [sponsoring expedited fixes](#) or [commissioning new features](#). You can also [submit a pull request](#) â€” after all, it is open-source!
